# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to Awesome AI-Agents! Please take a moment to review these guidelines before submitting your contribution.

## Adding to the List

- **Search previous suggestions** before making a new one to avoid duplicates.
- **Make an individual pull request** for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.`
- **Additions should be added alphabetically** to the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be discussed in an issue first.

## Quality Standards

- **Keep descriptions concise and clear.** Aim for one sentence that captures the essence of the tool.
- **Start descriptions with a capital letter** and end with a period.
- Don't mention "AI" or "agent" in every description - it's implied by the list context.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The pull request should have a meaningful title and include a link to the tool and why it should be included.

## Tool/Resource Requirements

To be added to this list, tools and resources should meet these criteria:

- **Actively maintained** - The project should show signs of recent activity (commits, issues, releases).
- **Functional** - The tool should be available for use (not just announced or in private beta).
- **Relevant** - Must be directly related to AI agents, autonomous coding, or developer productivity enhancement through AI.
- **Quality** - Should provide genuine value to developers and represent best-in-class or notable alternatives.
- **Documentation** - Should have clear documentation or explanation of what it does.

## Link Requirements

- **Use HTTPS links** where available.
- **Link to GitHub repositories** when the project is open-source.
- **Link to official websites** for commercial products or services.
- Avoid linking to:
  - Affiliate links
  - Comparison sites or review aggregators
  - Outdated or archived projects (unless historically significant)

## Updating Your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer will ask you to edit your pull request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match these guidelines.
